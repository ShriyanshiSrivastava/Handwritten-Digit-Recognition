## Result and Analysis

- We discovered that CNN provided the best accurate results. As a result, we may infer that CNN is the best choice for any form of prediction task involving picture data.
- Following the model's construction, we compiled it using the Adam optimizer and a specific cross-entropy loss function, both of which are customary in the creation of a convolution neural network.
- Training set size affects the accuracy and accuracy increases as the number of data increases. The more data in the training set, the smaller the impact of training error and test error, and ultimately the accuracy can be improved.
